üìä Project Insights

‚Ä¢	Food and Beverages is the top-performing product category in terms of both quantity sold and revenue.

‚Ä¢	Branch C has consistently outperformed other branches in sales, suggesting higher customer footfall or better marketing.

‚Ä¢	E-wallet and Cash are the most preferred payment methods.

‚Ä¢	Member customers tend to spend more on average compared to non-members.
